 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

# Description

   Hello and welcome to my E-Commerce application. I created this application as a way to show off what I have learned about API's and how to implement them on the back end. this simple application allows a user to see, update, delete and add a product all from the server side. I was able to check all functionality using Insomnia. This propject was a challeneging at times, but it allowed me an opppurtunity to further hone my troubleshooting skills while working on a more complex application.
